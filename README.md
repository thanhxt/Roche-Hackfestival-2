# Roche Hackfestival Project

> Our idea was to simplify the process of tracking workplace-related carbon footprints for employees by leveraging the existing company access cards. We aimed to automate much of the data collection, reducing the need for manual input from users.
> This data encompasses commute distances, modes of transportation, and office-related activities such as meeting room usage and printing.
